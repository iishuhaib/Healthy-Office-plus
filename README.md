# Healthy-Office-plus

This is a project carried out by Team 4 Bits from Informatics Institute of Technology.

This project is based on a smart IOT product which is used to monitor the sitting pattern of office based employees. In order to detect the presence of the employees at the desk area, two sensors are permanently fixed beneath the work table of the employee. The values generated from these two sensors are logically "and" operated to activate the trigger pin, use of triggers along with mail and SMS integration, as soon as the pin is triggered an email is sent and once the sitting pattern of the user is detected it sends notification to the android based application. The mobile application integrates the current healthiness of the user via an avatar. To keep the avatar healthy, user must be in a good healthy condition. Further more, we are planning to monitor the user and create a pattern of the behavior, and get more flexible according to each user.
